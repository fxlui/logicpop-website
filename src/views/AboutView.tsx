        <p>
          We are a small multi-talented team that are able to put on different
          hats, handling user interface designs to system implementations for
          all things web and mobile.

        <p>
          And we are serious about making software accessible to everyone, from
          digital-surfing millenials to grocery-shopping grandmas.
